						OPINION: Why Bioshock Infinite is the greatest game ever made… probably.  Seriously though, I talk about my time with Bioshock Infinite (SPOILER FREE) and everything I liked about it.  More importantly what I think it represents for the gaming industry as a whole.

						Fire Emblem Awakening blew my mind, and made me buy the system I dismissed as a cheap gimmick.  Having never played a Fire Emblem game before I really wasn’t sure what to expect going into this.  After hearing some very positive reviews, both from professionals and friends, I decided to give it a try.  10 hours later… and one small scuffle with my friend over who has the right to play “his” 3DS I went out and bought a 3DS and the game… been loving every second since.
