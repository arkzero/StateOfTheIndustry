					Bioshock Infinite seemed like one of those games that would end up being in development hell forever.  Originally supposed to be released in February of 2011 the game was hit with three major delays and it did not end up releasing until just over two years later.  Now I’m here to tell you it was worth the wait.  Kevin Levine and the team at Irrational Games wanted to release a project that they would be proud of, sometimes scrapping entire gameplay features and starting from scratch.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is extremely evident with the character of Elizabeth.  Early testers of the game hated Elizabeth, saying that the entire game felt like one giant escort mission, a gaming mortal sin.  She was clearly refined over the course of years of development and the end product was a character that did not get in the way of the gameplay, but actually enhanced it.  Irrational Games spent a great deal of timing making sure that the player forms an emotional connection with Elizabeth they accomplish this by actual mechanics, such as her reviving you if you die, or throwing you items in the middle of a heated combat section.  The mechanics are complimented by literally hours of dialogue between her and Booker throughout the slower sections of the game that flesh out both of their characters into something that can be easy for gamers to care about.
				</p>
				<p>
					The actual combat in Infinite builds upon the amazing mechanics from the original Bioshock.  Plasmids are once again present, although renamed Vigors, and the gunplay is just as solid as the original.  The game adds two new features that add to the already amazing mechanics of the series.  Booker can use his Skyhook to zip around on Skylines during combat to either make a quick escape or provide a moving target for his enemies to shoot at.  The second is once again tied to Elizabeth, using her powers to manipulate space time, she can open tears on the battlefield to give an edge to any player particular style.  These tears range from Automatic turrets and robots that help you in combat to cover and sniping ledges that the player can use to gain a terrain advantage.  
				</p>
				<p>
					The enemy AI in Infinite is some of the smartest AI I’ve seen in an FPS.  Enemies will attempt to flank you in strategic patterns and even hop on skylines to follow you in your attempted retreat.  I was a little disappointed however that Infinite does not have an enemy that parallels the raw power and fear of the Big Daddy.  This is somewhat solved by the fact that the game has about 6 “heavy hitters” that definitely mix up gameplay whenever they are introduced.  Some like the Handymen and the Mechanized Patriots appear throughout the game, while others like the Siren and Boys of Silence and confined to specific levels.  While they don’t capture the “OH !*$@” factor of the Big Daddy’s  they definitely keep the player on their toes during combat.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now the most remarkable thing about Bioshock Infinite in my opinion, is the city of Columbia itself.  Like Rapture before it is a completely vibrant and unique environment that will just make you want to explore and find all it’s dark hidden secrets.  One thing that actually made me like Columbia a lot more that rapture is you actually get to see it before every goes to hell, and actually see the process of it completely falling into anarchy unlike Rapture where you show up during the aftermath.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, I’ve purposely been staying away from the story elements of Bioshock, but I assure you it is absolutely incredible.  And yes, it does have an incredible twist at the end, and try as hard you want to find it, unless you are some sort of literary and physics genius, your jaw will hit the floor just as fast as mine did when the game finally pulls back the curtain on everything going on behind the scenes.
