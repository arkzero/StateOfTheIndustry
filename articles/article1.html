				<h1>Why I Bought a 3DS</h1>

					When the 3DS first launched just over two years ago, I dismissed it as a cheap gimmick.  To me the system seemed just like a rehash of the DS.  This was not made better by the fact that all of the launch titles were just remakes of previously released games.  As time went on and the 3DS started getting a better games library, I considered getting one, seeing many games that I would be willing to play; none of these games really made me want to spend $180 on a new hand held.
				</p>
				<p>
					All of this changed when my roommate got Fire Emblem: Awakening.  He has been a fan of the series for a while, and told me the general premise of the game’s mechanics.  I was pretty interested and after a little bit of convincing I decided to try the game out on his system, creating a new file and seeing how I liked.  10 hours and a rather heated argument over whose game it technically was later… I decided to go out and buy get myself a 3DS and Awakening.
				</p>
				<p>
					While I never actually played a strategy RPG before, I’ve played my fair share of RPGs and Turn based strategy games, very much liking both genres.  So it’s no surprise that I almost immediately fell in love with the game; the complexity and nuisances that exist in the game and breathe taking and astounding.  
				</p>
				<p>
					The class system in the game is probably my favorite feature, there are a number of different classes that all function differently, have their own strengths and weaknesses, and provide the characters with their own unique skills.  This system is made even better by the fact that the game allows you to prestige and reclass your characters allowing them to gain a collection of skills that make them essentially a group of super soldiers.  
				</p>
				<p>
					The game also gives you the ability to marry your characters together.  And then the characters can have kids and the kids inherit their parent’s stats.  This brought about a whole new level of meta game that I hadn’t experienced since I genetically engineered super Pokemon in SoulSilver.  
				</p>
				<p>
					While I originally felt that story was rather dull… and a little to Japanese for my tastes.  The absolutely amazing gameplay kept me playing not really caring about the, in my opinion, lack luster story.  This however completely changed around the 1/3 point in the game where the story totally blew up and I started loving it just as much as the game’s incredible mechanics.  
				</p>
				<p>
					To summarize, Fire Emblem Awakening is an amazing game that that makes the 3DS a worthy purchase.  It combines RPG and Turn based strategy elements into a completely complex and rewarding system that should definitely be checked out by anyone who likes RPGS, Turn Based Strategy Games, or Strategy RPGs.
