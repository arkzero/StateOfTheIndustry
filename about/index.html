			<p>
				We are a group of college students currently studying game design at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.  We all naturally keep up with the events is the industry and quiet often we have discussions about recent events and share our opinions.  These discussions tend to be both thought provoking and hilarious because quite often our opinions do not match.  For example our debate about lives in modern video games was bloody… 
			</p>
			<p>
				State of the Industry aims to discuss developments in both game design/development and as the name implies the state of the industry as a whole.  We will discuss everything from company’s business models and how that affects both their sales and image to mechanics in new games and how we feel they will be received both by critics and fans alike.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Since we’re just poor nobodies with no one to answer to, the opinions we present will be entirely our own (mostly) uncensored thoughts.  We haven’t sold out yet… however if anyone wants us to sell out, just show us where we need to sign.

						<h2>Bryan Nissen</h2>
						<p>
							I am an aspiring Developer/Designer that is currently studying game design and working on small indie/mobile games on the side.  I'm generally a positive person that tries to see the bright side of even the darkest of situations, this is why most people on the internet anger me to an incredible degree.  I like RPG's or really any game that can convey a story that would not be possible in any other medium.

						<h2>James Provinicalli</h2>
						<p>
							I like to play games so now I am attempting to learn how to maek games. I have a WiiU and all the past generation of consoles (see what I did there?) I just recently got a gaming computer so I am just now discovering how awesome Steam really is, which is funny since I have had it for 8 years, 4 months longer than Bryan, which really pisses him off. 2D Metroidvanias are the bee’s knees. Brutal Legend is awesome. My 360 dashboard isn’t mine anymore; its Microsoft’s marketing division and reading comments on Joystiq and IGN really piss me off.

						<h2>Dan Michalak</h2>
						<p>
							Decent programmer, wannabe writer. Cynical and intellectual, but pretty scatterbrained. Probably for-real addicted to TvTropes and Mount & Blade: Warband. I like my games with interesting philosophy, deep stories, and player freedom. RPGs and Turn-Based Strategies are probably my favorite genres. I like when game companies give their employees creative freedom and don’t just try to create money machines and pander to the lowest common denominator.
